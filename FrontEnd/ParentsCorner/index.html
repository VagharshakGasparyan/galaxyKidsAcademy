                        Family involvement, family satisfaction, and shared
                        decision making about your child’s experience are
                        essential to the Galaxy Kids Academy program. We believe
                        the center forms a caring and learning community in
                        which families, staff, and children can interact and
                        grow. We actively work to support family life and create
                        ways to involve families in our program. Family
                        involvement is an all-purpose term that encompasses
                        family partnership groups and committees, volunteering,
                        family education, and special events. We believe the key
                        to family involvement is giving families a variety of
                        ways to be involved, if they are able, in the life of
                        the center.

                    <p class="body-font">
                        The family-teacher partnership at Galaxy Kids Academy
                        helps children build a positive attitude toward
                        themselves, toward language, literacy, and all other
                        areas of the curriculum. Together, we can provide a
                        stronger program for your child to foster a lifelong
                        love of learning. The best teacher and family
                        partnerships are based on frequent opportunities to
                        share information. You can strengthen your family’s role
                        as your child’s first and most important teacher and
                        share in learning by participating in activities at home
                        as well as at the center.

                        We are committed to creating a strong home and center
                        connection by developing a process of open, honest
                        communication with you regarding your child’s
                        development and experience at the center. This includes
                        a continual exchange of information between you and the
                        center staff and management.

                                It is important that everyone who cares for your
                                child has a sense of his or her daily
                                experience, both at home and in the center.
                                Staggered scheduling of staff makes the
                                Electronic Communication System a critical
                                communication link. The emails will give you a
                                sense of your child’s day and keep you informed
                                about his or her experiences and may also
                                include a picture of your child in action.
                                Parents may also send messages to your child’s
                                teacher before arriving at the center to share
                                information about your child’s morning to help
                                with drop off time, making it easier for you to
                                head off to work.
