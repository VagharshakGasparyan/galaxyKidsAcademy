                    <p class="body-font">
                        A Galaxy Kids Academy contract form must be completed
                        and returned to center management along with the
                        registration fee (where applicable). Upon receipt of the
                        contract and first month contract fee, your child will
                        be registered based on availability. If current space is
                        not available to meet your needs, your family’s name
                        will be placed on a waiting list. We cannot guarantee
                        that a space will be available for your child on the day
                        you desire. Enrollment is based on availability and may
                        be subject to priority enrollment rules of the center.
                        Families may choose to be on the wait list at Galaxy
                        Kids Academy with payment of a single registration fee,
                        where permitted. When a space becomes available, the
                        center will invite you to visit with your child to
                        discuss the enrollment process. The visit will give your
                        child an opportunity to spend time in his or her
                        classroom and be introduced to the children and staff.
                        During the visit, you will have an opportunity to
                        observe your child in the classroom, meet with center
                        management to schedule a start date, and review the
                        enrollment procedure. Registration is required annually.

                    <h2>Enrollment Procedure</h2>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        In order to secure appropriate staffing levels at all
                        times of the day, we will ask you to provide the
                        specific hours of care needed for your child,
                        recognizing that you may need to change these
                        periodically. Prior to your child’s start date, please
                        feel free to schedule as many visits as necessary to
                        help familiarize you and your child with the center.
                        This is an excellent way to help your child feel
                        comfortable in his or her classroom. During the
                        enrollment process, you must complete forms regarding
                        your child’s health and development. These forms include
                        family information, a medical authorization and consent
                        form, and a developmental history. An updated physical
                        and immunization record is required for your child prior
                        to enrollment. You are also expected to read and sign an
                        enrollment contract that outlines the program’s
                        policies. All forms in your child’s file must be updated
                        annually. Please remember to provide the center with
                        additional updates as needed (e.g., phone numbers, work
                        information, change of emergency contact or medical
                        information, including allergies).

                    <p class="body-font">
                        Our contract year extends from September 1 through
                        August 31 of each year. A contract may be arranged by
                        the parent for any portion or for the full contract
                        period. Contracts will be updated at the end of each
                        year, August 31. In the event you find that you need to
                        discontinue services prior to the end date of the
                        contract, one month written notice must be provided.
                        Your monthly fee will be adjusted from that start of the
                        contract to the new ending date. Parents requesting to
                        cancel contracts to modify days in attendance may do so
                        once during the contract year by providing a one month
                        written notice. Additional requests will be honored by
                        the center after receiving payment of the $100 contract
                        cancellation fee. Contracts must be signed by all
                        parties responsible for payments. If parents elect to
                        arrange payments from multiple responsible individuals,
                        separate signed contracts will be required for all
                        parties the agency is asked to bill for services.
