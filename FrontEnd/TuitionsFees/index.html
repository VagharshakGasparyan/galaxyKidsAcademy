                    <h2>Tuition Investment/Fees</h2>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        Tuition is due in advance with no deductions for any
                        absences, holidays, illness, or closures due to
                        inclement weather, power outages, or other situations
                        beyond Galaxy Kids Academy’s control. If tuition is not
                        paid on the day that it is due, a late fee will be added
                        to the tuition for each day that it is late until it is
                        paid in full. When a payment is delinquent for one week
                        or more, care may be suspended until the balance is
                        current and your child’s space will not be reserved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        Tuition is due regardless of a child’s absence from the
                        program for any reason, and is required to hold a
                        child’s space. A fee will be charged for a check
                        returned for insufficient funds. If this occurs, Galaxy
                        Kids Academy will have the option to refuse any future
                        checks. There may be additional fees associated with
                        special summer activities or field trips for the
                        children. When you withdraw your child, you must give
                        one month’s notice prior to withdrawal, in writing, to
                        center management.

                    <p class="body-font">
                        Payments are due, as per your contract, regardless of a
                        child’s absence for any reason. These include a child’s
                        illness, family illness, vacations, doctor appointments,
                        parent’s days off work, etc.

                    <p class="body-font">
                        Please check with the center for the present fee
                        schedule. At the time of registration, parents of
                        children who receive child care services may choose the
                        following payment option:

                    <p class="body-font">
                        OPTION A: Payment is due in full on the first of each
                        month, for the current month. After the 5th of each
                        month, a $25.00 late fee will be added to the amount due
                        for each child with an outstanding balance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        Payment for additional services received outside of the
                        contracted hours are due at the time services are
                        provided.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-font body-font-bold">
                        If tuition is delinquent for a period of ten (10) days,
                        the child will be suspended from the center. At that
                        time, the parent must then make payment arrangements for
                        the outstanding balance. Parents may re-instate their
                        enrollment by making appropriate payment arrangements
                        with the Center Director. Accounts left unpaid
                        accumulate late fees and if necessary are sent to a
                        collection agency.

                    <h2>Tuition Subsidies</h2>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        Parents who receive assistance for child care, must have
                        proof of current authorization, showing the amount to be
                        received for assistance each week, prior to
                        registration. If a child starts prior to authorization
                        approval, or if there is a lapse time between approvals,
                        the parent is responsible for 100% of the tuition
                        payments until the center receives notice of
                        authorization. The parent is liable for any of the
                        tuition that is not covered by the payments received
                        from the assistance program.

                    <p class="body-font">
                        *Note: Galaxy Kids Academy requires that parents sign in
                        and out recording the times in the classroom in addition
                        to clocking in and out at our security entrance
                        computer. Parents must also note any absences on the
                        classroom attendance sheet with the reason for the
                        absence from our program. Parents who fail to log their
                        hours or absence on the classroom attendance sheets will
                        be responsible for the amount normally billed by the
                        center.
