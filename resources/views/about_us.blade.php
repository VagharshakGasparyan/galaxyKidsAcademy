            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="body-font">
                Our role is to supplement, but not take the place of,
                the primary role of families in providing care for their
                children. By establishing and maintaining open and
                ongoing communication with families, we are able to
                strengthen the ties that connect the home with our
                center and enhance the individual development of the
                child(ren) in our care. When families entrust their
                children to us, we are challenged to have a significant
                and positive influence by providing a program of the
                highest quality designed to help give children the
                foundation they need to build self-esteem, develop
                school readiness, and reach their full potential in
                learning.

            <h2>Our Philosophy Galaxy</h2>
            <p class="body-font">
                Kids Academy strives to provide a quality Early
                Childhood Education Program filled with carefully chosen
                staff members, filled with love and compassion for
                children. We believe that children are our most
                important resource and that their early childhood
                experiences are crucial in the development of their
                future. Each staff member strives to offer an
                environment that is rich in quality and stimulates the
                child’s senses and where warmth and friendship are
                abundant, to meet the needs of the total development of
                your child. The program we pursue is geared toward
                helping your child develop habits of observation,
                questioning and listening while building a positive
                self-esteem. Our staff members are partners with our
                parents working together to meet both the needs of the
                children and their families.

            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p class="body-font">
                Galaxy Kids Academy strives to provide an educational
                program to every child enrolled while offering a network
                of support to each family as a whole. Our teachers work
                in partnership with each family to identify individual
                goals and plans for the children. The curriculum we
                implement provides a comprehensive program for children
                and work toward development in the areas of
                communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving,
                and personal-social.
            </p>
            <p class="body-font">
                As children 3, 4, and 5 years-old transition into our
                preschool program, their goals focus on developing
                approaches to learning, social and emotional
                development, physical development and health, language,
                literacy, and communication, mathematics, creative arts,
                science and technology, and social studies. Progress
                occurs when adults reinforce the child’s learning.
                Teachers support children at their current ability
                level, as well as provide opportunities for them to
                advance toward the next level of development. Program
                success requires a strong partnership with each family.
                Teachers, administrators, and parents work together to
                utilize a variety of resources within the program as
                well as the community, to ensure that all members of the
                family receive the support they need and/or desire.
