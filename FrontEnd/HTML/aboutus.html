                        children. By establishing and maintaining open and
                        ongoing communication with families, we are able to
                        strengthen the ties that connect the home with our
                        center and enhance the individual development of the
                        child(ren) in our care. When families entrust their
                        children to us, we are challenged to have a significant
                        and positive influence by providing a program of the
                        highest quality designed to help give children the
                        foundation they need to build self-esteem, develop
                        school readiness, and reach their full potential in
                        learning.

                    <p class="body-font">
                        Kids Academy strives to provide a quality Early
                        Childhood Education Program filled with carefully chosen
                        staff members, filled with love and compassion for
                        children. We believe that children are our most
                        important resource and that their early childhood
                        experiences are crucial in the development of their
                        future. Each staff member strives to offer an
                        environment that is rich in quality and stimulates the
                        child’s senses and where warmth and friendship are
                        abundant, to meet the needs of the total development of
                        your child. The program we pursue is geared toward
                        helping your child develop habits of observation,
                        questioning and listening while building a positive
                        self-esteem. Our staff members are partners with our
                        parents working together to meet both the needs of the
                        children and their families.

                    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        Galaxy Kids Academy strives to provide an educational
                        program to every child enrolled while offering a network
                        of support to each family as a whole. Our teachers work
                        in partnership with each family to identify individual
                        goals and plans for the children. The curriculum we
                        implement provides a comprehensive program for children
                        and work toward development in the areas of
                        communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving,
                        and personal-social.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-font">
                        As children 3, 4, and 5 years-old transition into our
                        preschool program, their goals focus on developing
                        approaches to learning, social and emotional
                        development, physical development and health, language,
                        literacy, and communication, mathematics, creative arts,
                        science and technology, and social studies. Progress
                        occurs when adults reinforce the child’s learning.
                        Teachers support children at their current ability
                        level, as well as provide opportunities for them to
                        advance toward the next level of development. Program
                        success requires a strong partnership with each family.
                        Teachers, administrators, and parents work together to
                        utilize a variety of resources within the program as
                        well as the community, to ensure that all members of the
                        family receive the support they need and/or desire.
